## AI Usage Documentation

### 1. Chat Logs

To begin, I utilized ChatGPT-4o to draft a comprehensive requirements document. The goal was to capture all project specifications in a clear, structured format that could be easily referenced or processed by other AI models throughout the development workflow.

Example: [ChatGPT Conversation](https://chatgpt.com/share/68918a76-50a8-8010-b100-06ff50311b6d)

### 2. LLM Models Used
The following AI models were utilized throughout the project:

- **ChatGPT-4o**: Used initially for requirements gathering and documentation.
- **Claude Sonnet 4**: Assisted in planning, architectural decisions, and codebase development.
- **GitHub Copilot**: Provided minor code refinements, suggestions, and touch-ups directly within the IDE.

### 3. Tools / Integrations
The following platforms and integrations were used to interact with AI models during development:

- **ChatGPT Mac App**: Used for initial requirements gathering and documentation.
- **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**: Served as the primary development environment.
- **Cline Extension for VS Code**: Enabled seamless access to multiple AI models (including ChatGPT-4o and Claude Sonnet 4) via the OpenRouter API, facilitating code generation, planning, and refinement directly within the editor.

### 4. Key Prompts & Refinements

#### Example Initial Prompt (Refined)
"I have a task that needs to be completed in Flutter for mobile platforms. I will provide detailed information about the task. Let's begin by creating a comprehensive document that gathers all relevant requirements and context, which can later be used by an LLM to assist in developing the project. Please review the details, ask clarifying questions, and help design the requirements document to ensure all aspects are covered and any ambiguities are resolved."

After compiling the requirements document, I referenced it throughout the development process. The full chat history is available for review and provides additional context and decision-making rationale.

Once the Product Requirements Document (PRD) or detailed context was finalized, I provided it to Claude Sonnet 4 via the Cline extension in VS Code. This enabled collaborative planning and iterative development, ultimately resulting in the completion of the app.
